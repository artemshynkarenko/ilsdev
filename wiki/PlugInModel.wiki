= Introduction =

As a _kernel_ of our system we use _abstract plug-in model_. At current stage it is only starting - so any comments with be *highly* appreciated.


= Details =

Main entity is plug-in([http://code.google.com/p/ilsdev/wiki/Interlogic.Trainings.Plugs.Kernel.Plug *Plug*]). Each plug-in define it's own [http://code.google.com/p/ilsdev/wiki/Interlogic.Trainings.Plugs.Kernel.BindingPoint *BindingPoint*s] for other plug-ins and binds through [http://code.google.com/p/ilsdev/wiki/Interlogic.Trainings.Plugs.Kernel.BindingPoint *Binding*s] to existing plugs. As a store for this system we will use database

On registering by *PluginInstaller* plug files (*PlugFiles*) are copied to requested locations(*PlugLocation*), its own interfaces and implementations (*ClassDefinition*) are installed and links ( defining own pluggable points(*BindingPoints*) or binding to existing(*Binding*)) are created.
